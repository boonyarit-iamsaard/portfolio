## My Journey

My path to software development is a bit unconventional. For years, I honed a keen eye for detail and precision as an Aircraft Mechanic. When the pandemic shifted our world, I discovered a passion for coding and immersed myself in full-stack development. I independently learned the tools and technologies needed to build modern web applications. Even while working as an Aircraft Mechanic, I applied my developing skills to create an internal department system using Next.js and TypeScript. This experience solidified my love for problem-solving through code. Now, I'm focused on developing efficient, high-performance applications, particularly within the React and Node.js ecosystems, and I strive for clean, scalable solutions.

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm working as a Backend Engineer, contributing to the development and enhancement of server-side logic for various applications. I'm focused on applying my backend skills in a collaborative team environment to deliver impactful results.

## Skills

Here's a snapshot of my technical skills:

- **Languages:** TypeScript (most proficient & ❤️), JavaScript
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Tools & Practices:** Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Docker, Unit Testing (e.g., Jest, Mocha), E2E Testing (e.g., Playwright)
