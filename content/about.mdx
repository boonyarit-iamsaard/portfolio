## Hi, I'm Boonyarit

{/* TODO: improve bio */}
My journey into software development began during the pandemic, transitioning from a detail-oriented background in aircraft maintenance. While my current role focuses on backend engineering, I possess comprehensive full-stack development skills, specializing in the React and Node.js ecosystems. I am passionate about collaborating within teams to build efficient, high-performance applications. My focus is on delivering scalable solutions with clean, maintainable code that directly contributes to business growth, leveraging my expertise across the entire stack.

I am currently working as a Backend Engineer, where I have the opportunity to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects. My role involves building and maintaining scalable backend systems, optimizing performance, and ensuring code quality. I am also involved in team collaboration and knowledge sharing, fostering a dynamic and collaborative environment.
