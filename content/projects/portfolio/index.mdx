## Overview

**boonyarit.me** is my personal portfolio website, meticulously crafted to showcase my projects, technical skills, and professional journey. It acts as a dynamic digital resume and a central hub for potential employers, collaborators, and fellow developers. The core goal was to build a modern, performant, and accessible online presence that truly reflects my passion for web development and commitment to quality. This project is under active development, with ongoing improvements and feature additions.

## Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless and intuitive experience across all devices, from large desktops to small mobile screens.
- **Integrated Blog**: A dedicated space where I share technical insights, development tutorials, and updates on my latest projects.
- **User-Friendly Dark Mode**: Offers a comfortable viewing experience in low-light conditions with an easy-to-toggle theme switcher.
- **Highly Performance Optimized**: Engineered for speed using modern web techniques, resulting in fast load times and smooth user interactions.
- **SEO Enhanced**: Implemented with SEO best practices, including structured data and relevant meta tags, to maximize visibility on search engines.

## Development Process

This portfolio was built using the **Next.js App Router** and **TypeScript**, providing a modern, type-safe foundation. Content management leverages **Velite** to process local **MDX** files (projects, articles) into type-safe JSON data during the build. This approach enables efficient **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for content-heavy pages, ensuring fast load times and excellent SEO.

The user interface was crafted with **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, complemented by pre-built, accessible components from **Shadcn UI**. This combination allowed for rapid development while maintaining a consistent design language. Key considerations included:

- **Performance:** Leveraging Next.js features like automatic code splitting, font optimization (`src/core/styles/fonts.ts`), and built-in image optimization. SSG further minimizes server load and improves TTFB (Time to First Byte).
- **Content Integration:** Using `@next/mdx` and `rehypeShiki` (via Velite config) for seamless rendering and syntax highlighting of Markdown content.
- **Modularity:** Organizing the codebase using a feature-sliced structure (`src/features`) to enhance maintainability and scalability.
- **Deployment:** The site is deployed globally via **Vercel**, taking advantage of its seamless Git integration and CDN for optimal performance and availability.
