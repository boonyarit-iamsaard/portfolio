When working with built-in Node.js modules, how you import them matters more than you might think. The syntax you choose can affect clarity, performance, compatibilityâ€”and even how easily your codebase scales.

This guide walks through the different import styles and offers a practical rule-of-thumb approach to picking the best one.

For the record, these are not hard rulesâ€”but they _are_ sensible defaults that align with modern Node.js practices (especially from v16 onward).

## TL;DR

- Use `import { method } from 'node:module'`
- Why? It's explicit, tree-shakable, IDE-friendly, and future-ready.

## `import` in Node.js: The Big Picture

Node.js has come a long way from `require()`. With ES modules (ESM) support stabilized in modern versions, it's time to level up how we import built-in modules.

But here's the catch, you've got options. Let's break them down.

### ðŸ”¹ Default Import

```js
import fs from 'fs';
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Are you importing the entire module for convenienceâ€”even if you don't need everything?

- Brings in the whole module as a default export.
- Less efficient for bundlers and tree-shaking.
- Fine for quick scripts, but suboptimal for larger apps.

### ðŸ”¹ Named Import

```js
import { readFile } from 'fs';
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Do you only need a specific function or method?

- Imports _only_ what you need.
- More readable and efficient.
- Plays nicely with tree-shaking and autocomplete.

### ðŸ”¹ Node Protocol Import

```js
import fs from 'node:fs';
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Want to make it crystal clear you're using a Node built-in?

- The `node:` prefix tells both humans and tools it's a built-in module.
- Reduces ambiguity, especially in monorepos or when mixing npm packages with similar names.

### âœ… The Sweet Spot: Named + `node:` Prefix

```js
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { join } from 'node:path';
```

**Rule of Thumb:** Do you want clarity, efficiency, and future-proofing all at once?

- Best of both worlds.
- Clear, focused, and modern.
- Supported in Node.js 16+.

## ðŸ“š Common Module Examples

Here's how to apply these patterns across popular built-in modules:

### File System

```js
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
```

### Path

```js
import { dirname, join, resolve } from 'node:path';
```

### URL

```js
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
```

### Utils

```js
import { promisify } from 'node:util';
```

## âœ… Best Practices Checklist

**Use this:**

```js
import { method } from 'node:module';
```

**Because:**

- `node:` prefix is explicit and modern
- Named imports help reduce bundle size
- Improves readability and IDE support
- Easier to audit and refactor
- Plays well with ESM and future tooling

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

Think of your imports as the opening sentence of your code's story. The clearer and more intentional they are, the easier it is for others (and future-you) to follow along. By using the `node:` protocol and named imports, you're writing Node.js the way it's meant to be written in 2025.

Small choices add upâ€”so import smart, stay sharp, and keep your codebase clean.

Happy coding ðŸš€
